    "One area they are used a lot is in deep learning models. Let's say you are predicting if a picture is a 1, 2, 3, ... 0. You can run a model for each number to give you probabilities of the handwriting being each number, and then choose the highest one. This is what softmax (normalizing the different individual probabilities into a total probability - that is, all probabilities of each ouptut equal one) and its cost function, cross-entropy are for."
